wrapper_sampling
Wraps up all the functions below. From the splitted video.mp4 it converts it into BitArray, samples it, saves 
the dict of the counts and local maxima and coarse-grains it for the next iteraiton (in this order). 
TODO : include video splitting and final merging of all the dicts
Inputs :

- results_path::String -> where the results will be saved
- file_name::String -> the name of the video
- num_of_iterations::Int -> how many times we will sample and coarse-grain the movie 
							(includes the 1st, which is the initially binarized video)
- glider_coarse_g_dim::Tuple{3} -> three dimensional tuple that tells us how the coarse-graining is done
- glider_dim::Tuple{3} -> three dimensional tuple that tells us how the sampling is done
- percentile::Int -> top (most frequent) % of loc_max that will be stored
