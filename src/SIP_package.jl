wrapper_sampling
Wraps up all the functions below. From the splitted video.mp4 it converts it into BitArray, samples it, saves 
the dict of the counts and local maxima and coarse-grains it for the next iteraiton (in this order).

Inputs :

- results_path::String -> where the results will be saved
- file_name::String -> the name of the video

							(includes the 1st, which is the initially binarized video)
- glider_coarse_g_dim::Tuple{3} -> three dimensional tuple that tells us how the coarse-graining is done
- glider_dim::Tuple{3} -> three dimensional tuple that tells us how the sampling is done
- percentile::Int -> top (most frequent) % of loc_max that will be stored

"""
template_matching
Loops through the video and finds the patches that correspond to the local maxima in the dict along with
the surrounding pixels, to find the analogues of Stephens 2013 fig 4 in our experiment.
It skips the patches that are at the borders because not extendible (artifacts deriving from possible paddings are
worse than sampling less patches).
It loops through the video, finds the features that match the loc_max_dict keys, adds the matches and their surroundings 
to a storage (surr_dict[win][1]), while keeping track of how many matches were found (surr_dict[win][2]) for further averaging.
The final step would be the averaging itself (avg_patch = surr_dict[win][1] / surr_dict[win][2]), but we preferred to leave it out 
for possible parallelization (it will require merging the dicts).
